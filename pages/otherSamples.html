        <h2>School Hackathon Participation</h2>
        <p>
            In a challenging all-day hackathon, my partner and I took on a series of tasks, each presenting unique challenges in Python, MySQL, and HTML/CSS. Independently, each language demanded a distinct set of problem-solving skills. The Python challenges delved into algorithmic intricacies, MySQL required precise database management, and HTML/CSS demanded a keen eye for crafting a polished user interface. Despite the independence of these challenges, we seamlessly integrated solutions, emphasizing our versatility and proficiency in each language. This experience not only fortified our technical skills but also showcased our ability to adapt and collaborate effectively in a dynamic, multi-language coding environment.

        <h2>Open Source Contributions</h2>
        <p>
            Contributing to open source projects has been a rewarding journey. I made significant contributions to a popular JavaScript library, addressing critical bugs and introducing new functionalities. Collaborating with developers from around the world, I learned the importance of code quality and effective version control. This experience not only enhanced my technical proficiency but also taught me the nuances of collaborative coding practices in a global community.
